This repo contains:
- gerbers for a promicro compatible reversible pcb
- 3D models for a case
- ergogen code used to generate the pcb

What is the purpose of this?
To create a pcb that offers mounting holes, wiring for a reset button, and files for a protective case. 

Bill of materials:
- 4 M2 screws (5-6mm length)
- 4 M2 heatset inserts (any length <5mm will work)
- Panasonic EVQ-PU[A|C|J|L]02K (side-operated momentary switch)
- microcontroller with promicro footprint


This small project was inspired by falkenad who designed pcbs to be used with various nrf microcontrollers and oled screens.
I used ergogen to generate the pcb and designed the case in fusion360.
